                A trust is a legal arrangement where a trustee holds and manages property for the
                benefit of beneficiaries. When the trust document authorizes the sale of real
                property, or when circumstances require liquidation of trust assets, the trustee
                must follow specific procedures to ensure the sale is legally valid and protects the
                interests of all beneficiaries.
