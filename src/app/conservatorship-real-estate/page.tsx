              <p className="text-lg text-secondary-700 mb-6">
                Conservatorship property sales present unique challenges that don't arise in
                standard real estate transactions. Understanding these challenges and how to address
                them helps ensure successful sales that serve the conservatee's interests.

                <li>
                  <strong>Solution:</strong> Work with buyers who understand conservatorship sales
